I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Business Analytics at the Haslam College of Business, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/tinglianghuang'><strong>Tingliang Huang</strong></a>. 


Currently, I am interested in the interface between operation management and marketing. I am also interested in the application of machine learning to business analytics.
