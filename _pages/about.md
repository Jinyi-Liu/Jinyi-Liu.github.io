I am a first-year Ph.D. in Business Analytics at the Haslam College of Business, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/tinglianghuang'><strong>Tingliang Huang</strong></a>. 

Before I came to Knoxville, I earned my Bachelor of Economics in Finance from the University of Science and Technology of China, during which I took a lot of mathematics and statistics courses. After that, I received a Master of Arts in Economics from the University of Rochester in May 2022. 

Currently, I am interested in the interface between operation management and marketing.
